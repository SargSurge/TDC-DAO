# TDC-DAO
A private, permissioned decentralized autonomous organization for Theta Delta Chi at MIT.
The purpose of this DAO is to keep records of motions enacted in house meetings and positions elected.
The goal is not to use the DAO to store all the shenanigans of house meetings and all of our favorite committees but to make sure that what is important does not get lost. 
Currently, job of storing the fraternity's history of motions and ammendments to the bylaws relies on the elected Recording Secretary. The Rec Sec is tasked of taking notes of everything at house meeting and then taking those notes and uploading them to the Google Drive. That is the state of the position as of Spring 2021.
Now, I, the current Rec Sec, do not have any idea where notes are from before Fall 2019, or where they are in between me and Fall 2019. The record of motions is one of the important issues this DAO is intended to solve. 

## Use case of the DAO
Brother's will now propose motions on the DAO ahead of house meeting.
All un-voted on proposals in the DAO are new business at house meeting.
At the house meeting, the proposal is brought up and discussed.
Once discussed, the brothers may motion to vote or wait until the next meeting where it will be old business.

Old business will be motions that are marked as discussed or have been tabled, as is.
All active brother's have an equal vote, and get to cast a vote on the proposals, whether to pass, reject, table, or revise.
If the motion passes, the state of the motion is updated to show that it passed.
If the motion is tabled, the state of the motion is updated to show that it was tabled, and will be old business at the next meeting.
If the motion rejected, the state of the motion is updated to show that it was rejected.
If the motion will be revised, the state of the motion is updated to show that it will be revised, and the brother who submitted can submit a revision which will be brought up as old business at the next house meeting.

The DAO will allow brothers to propose motions, and vote on motions. In addition, the history of motions will be stored on the blockchain.

## Current Project Goals

 - Create an ERC20 Governance token to be distributed equally to active members (each member should have an equal vote)

 - Implement EIP-2767: Contract Ownership Governance as the foundation of the DAO

## Future Project Goals

 - Create a DApp interface for members to submit proposals and vote
